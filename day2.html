        <p> If you have Chromebooks in
             your classroom you will probably 
             have this happen to you on more than one occasion,
             your students go to type  
        </P>

            And of course, since students need to sign in to the 
            Chromebook in order to use it, this is essential and makes
            the Chromebook totally use
        </p>

            Like many teachers, I am sure if you have technical problems
            on your Chromebook you can call some sort of a tech department 
            for help. That said, sometimes it takes some time for the tech 
            department to get around to fixing your issue, and some 
            Chromebook issues are so easy to fix that its actually not 
            even worth calling the tech teamâ€¦ This is one of those issues!
